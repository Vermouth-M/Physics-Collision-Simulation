This project is a real-time 2D physics simulation built with C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). It demonstrates fundamental concepts of collision detection, collision response, and basic physics integration. 
The simulation provides an interactive environment where multiple objects (circles, rectangles, or polygons) move under applied forces, bounce off walls, and collide with each other according to physical rules.
